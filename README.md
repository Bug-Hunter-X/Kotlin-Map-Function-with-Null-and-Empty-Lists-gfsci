# Kotlin Map Function with Null and Empty List Handling

This example showcases how Kotlin's `map` function interacts with empty lists and nullable lists.  It highlights the importance of using the safe call operator (`?.`) to prevent `NullPointerException`s when dealing with potentially null lists.

The solution demonstrates a robust approach that handles both empty and nullable lists gracefully without crashing the program.
